Plugins


Summary

This text explains my view on how to use plugins for reading and writing styles.

Every style format has different abilities. Some style formats have more features than others.
So, it's important for the main program to know what is possible with a certain style format and what's not.

So, an important task for a style plugin is to give the main program a list of what is possible.
This means something like this:

    button
        bitmap
        font
        font color
    checkbox
        bitmap
        font
        font color

Another style might have the following capabilities:

    button
        bitmap
        alpha
        sizes
        font
        font color
        different states

    etc...

The user interface of the main program should addapt to the possibilities of a certain style format.

Some styles have the ability to add custom code (scripts).
Others are made up out of ini or xml based descriptions.
Even other styles are completely code based (like the Qt and KDE styles).

For the code based styles, there must be a way to read the style again into the program.
Parsing code to guess what's what is, in my opinion, not the best way to do this.
I'm thinking about using keywords in the code itself, or accompany the code with a settings file (xml file) with all the values and settings.




I guess that large parts of it can be seen as similar to koffice IO plugins.
